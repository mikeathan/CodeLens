## Troubleshooting

### .NET CLI not found

Ensure .NET SDK is installed and available in your PATH:

```bash
dotnet --version

### No coverage generated

Make sure your test projects include the `coverlet.collector` package:

```xml
<PackageReference Include="coverlet.collector" Version="6.0.0" />
```
